# Introduction

## Research question

The research question that we are attempting to answer with our analysis is a predictive question, and is stated as follows:
> Given clickstream and session data of a user who visits an e-commerce website, can we predict whether or not that visitor will make a purchase?

Nowadays, it is common for companies to sell their products online, with little to no physical presence such as a traditional brick and mortar store. Answering this question is critical for these types of companies in order to ensure that they are able to remain profitable. This information can be used to nudge a potential customer in real-time to complete an online purchase, increasing overall purchase conversion rates. Examples of nudges include highlighting popular products through social proof, and exit intent overlay on webpages.
